## About Me
I'm a Red Team Operator with a passion for offensive security, specializing in simulating advanced cyberattacks to identify and exploit vulnerabilities before the bad guys do. With a focus on penetration testing, social engineering, and advanced threat emulation, I help organizations strengthen their defenses and improve their overall security posture. Always staying ahead of the latest attack techniques, I thrive in fast-paced environments where creativity and problem-solving are key to outsmarting adversaries.
